											Talking about personal life, I like to watch movies and tv series, play video games, play basketball, eat, sleep, travel, and buying items. When traveling, I feel like I am at peace because there are no stress and complications. It is the time I can unwind from the tough times especially when I am traveling with my friends. They are also the main reason why traveling is so much fun. I would rather travel with my friends than travelling with myself. That is the best way I can do to get the stress out of my body. When travelling happens, I get so excited that I only want to do is to be in that moment.

											When I got to college, things were different. The closest to my heart stuck by me until now. We got to have different classmates which were unrecognizable faces. As time goes by, we got comfortable to be with each other, but I choose to stick to the people who are closest to me and would stick by me. We got through tough times and difficult times due to numerous projects and activities which was a training for everyone. Now, we are still here in the same class with the same schedule and I am happy about it.
										</p>
										<br>
										<p>
											How did I survive my senior high? With the help of my parents and friends, I got be comfortable to be with everyone. I treated everything as a training for myself to be ready in the future when the time comes. There were a lot of struggles and mistakes those past years, but I can see it as an improvement. With the help of my classmates and friends, I got to survive my senior high. I spend quite a lot of time playing video games, specifically in the PC and the PS4. I started to play games when I was just still a kid and I did not stop there. Until now, I am still addicted in playing different games on different platforms. That is why I got interested on IT related work.

										<p>
											My 1st most favorite application is the Facebook Messenger. The reason this is one of my favorite application because it helps me communicate with other people especially with my love ones, classmates, friends, and etc. I think I’ve been using it since I was 9 – 11 years old and it helped me throughout the years. In the early years, Messenger does not have any special features compared today, it can be accessed easily by tapping the chat head, chat with bots which will help you in certain tasks, use customized colors and nicknames, and etc. My 2nd most favorite application is the Facebook. It is where I find entertainment, amusement, amazing videos and photos which are shared with different users. The user can add other multiple users which connects them with each other. It has a lot of features, but I am going to tell the basics. Facebook can upload pictures and videos which will be shared publicly, chat with friends, play games, interacting with friends, and customize personal profile. I think I used this application for the past 12 or 13 years. My 3rd most favorite application is Google Chrome Web Browser. The reason this is one of my favorite application because it can access different websites. It helps me in doing school works, such as researches, browse the internet, download files, and etc. I think I used it for the past 10 years. It can download files which can be used for the other time which is the most convenient thing.

											For a 1,000 floor, the elevator's interface should be easy to use and easy to understand. If I were to design the interface, there will be a screen where it displays an AI Bot which will listen to the users’ voice. The AI Bot will ask the user for the floor number. After the AI Bot hears the floor number, it will display in the screen on what floor the elevator is heading to which is located at the upper part on the screen. Every time the elevator reaches different floors, it will automatically ask a user for the floor they want to go to. If the user already told their floor number, they can tap the button at the middle of the screen to cancel the AI Bot's action which will continue the movement of the elevator. Before reaching the destination, the AI Bot will give its friendly message to the user to make them happy. There will be a bell at the bottom left of the screen to contact the technician and a message button to notify the technician if the bell button does not work. The door automatically close if the sensor will not detect any movement or any barrier in the way. The design of everything will consist of warm colors and simple fonts so it will be pleasing to the eyes.

											<h3 class="color"> 4th Activity </h3>
											<br>
										<p>
											<h5 class="color">Problem:</h5>
											<p>
												<ul>
											<li>	Inaccuracy in recording the attendance </li>
											<li>	Students tend to record/sign another student’s attendance </li>
											<ol>	Students does not keep track on their absences and lates </ol>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<br>
											<h5 class="color">Needs:</h5>
											<p>
												<ul>
											<li>	Accurate recording of attendance (absences and lates) </li>
											<ol>	Attendance has a huge effect in student’s grade </ol>
											<ol>	Fair attendance records for those who came in class on time </ol>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<br>
											<h5 class="color">Solution:</h5>
											<p>
												<ul>
											<li>	Create a mobile application for teachers that will scan the RFID provided in the student’s ID </li>
											<ol>	The application will monitor the student’s attendance (absences and lates) </ol>
											<ol>	The scanner will display the time in and time out of students </ol>
											<ol>	Data will be stored in a cloud storage that can be managed by the teachers and viewed by the students to 			keep their records on track </ol>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<br>
											<h5 class="color">Why do we need to solve this problem?</h5>
											<p>
												<ul>
											<li>	To be fair for other students who came in class on time. </li>
											<li>	To notify a student if he or she is nearing to fail due to absences. </li>
											<li>	As per the APC Handbook 2019, students are only allowed to have limited absences. Attendance can affect student’s grade and might fail them. </li>

											<h5 class = "color"; align="center"> 1st Reflection </h5>
										<p>
											The 1st week of our subject “USERDES” was a different experience compared to other computer subject because it was more interactive and fun while using technology. I felt I was free to change something about our class and make it funnier. With professor allowing us to eat inside the computer room, I felt that we are taken care of our professor considering we should not eat inside a computer room. 
											With the start of the lessons and the discussion, I realized that thinking outside the box is an important thing do when it comes to technology since technology has a large variety of branches. With the help of our professor, I got to a point where thinking and planning a backup plan is important for an output. Thinking of an improvement to the output is essential because every output is still unperfect and it will never be perfect, it will just be a satisfaction for me and for the one who I will be submitting to. In our early stage, our professor told us that we should be communicating with others so that we can get ideas and scopes and limitation for a good quality project, which is true since my perspective of my project is different from what the others think of my project. The last thing I realized that not everything is a one-man team. Everyone still needs someone to help them in their task especially when there is a numerous of task that needs to be handled.

										</p>
										<br>
											<h5 class = "color"; align="center"> 2nd Reflection </h5>
										<p>
											I think that the need finding activity for our application and everyone's application is one of the most important discussion that happened for the improvement and for the betterment of our application since our application is still a draft and needs enhancing. Other people got to know our proposed application and got to have a better insight of it, making it transparent to them. We got to analyze our application thoroughly with the help of each other and we got to have an idea on how to improve it.
											It got difficult in the paper prototyping because there are a lot of ways you can make a prototype of an application and it was hard to do since it was all in a paper designing. It was hard to come up with a design that will please the users also to be easy to understand because designers and end users have a different approach in the application itself.

										</p>
										<br>
											<h5 class = "color"; align="center"> 3rd Reflection </h5>
										<p>
											Coding a website using different kinds of application was already difficult as it sounds because when I had my first coding about a website, I was in Junior High. We got to have a refresher when we were in Senior High. With all the different varieties of coding coming right at us, I forgot how to code using HTML. Now, using Github and Heroku was also challenging for me since I have no idea on how to use them both for my website. Even though I produced a simple code for my website, it was really stressful for a guy who forgot to code in HTML. After completing the code and launching the website, I was satisfied with it since it was simple and basic to look at. I think I could do better, but that was all I can do. I was confused on how to do the Github and Heroku at that time so with the help of my classmates, I got past the task
										</p>
										<br>
											<h5 class = "color"; align="center"> 4th Reflection </h5>
										<p>
											The game, for me, was really frustrating and difficult because of the common sense that was programmed in the website. At first, I thought everything was easy and simple, turns out, it was a mind game for all of us. The problem I had with the 1st part was the simplicity of the page. It was laid out like it was an ordinary fill out form of an application. The frustrating part was the “Terms and Conditions” part because the scroll speed was ridiculously slow. I tried numerous of ways on how to make it faster, but in the end, it was a waste of time since it was scrolling the same way it was before. I didn’t get to remember it all, but what I remembered from the next steps was another fill out application and the rest were pictures we get to choose. At the 2nd step to the 4th step I found out it was easy. Overall, it was fun and enjoyable at the same time.

											<h4 class="color">Problems:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li> Students who commit offenses (major and minor) doesn’t meet the consequences of their action. </li>	
											<li> Students lack in participation when it comes to violation reports.</li>
											<li> Students tend to keep quiet when their friends violate rules.</li>
											<li> Reporting directly through the discipline office can be a hassle for the students and they are afraid to expose their identity.</li>
											<li> Students are unaware of how many offenses they already accumulated/committed.</li>
											<li> Students didn’t know if their report for some faulty equipment was acknowledged.</li>
											<li> Problems/Offenses inside the school campus is not reported to the different offices that handles certain issues. </li>
											<li> Students tend to ignore issues in the school campus. </li>
											<li> Minor issues/offences lead to bigger problems.</li>
											<li> Noticed damages on equipment may lead to unusable equipment if not reported immediately </li>
										</ul>
										<br>
											<h4 class="color">Needs:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li> Fairness to all students. Student who violate should be sanctioned accordingly. </li>
											<li> An easy way to report violation without risking the student’s identity.</li>
											<li> Send reports regarding any problems/issues to the different offices. </li>
											<li> Decrease any problems/issues in the school campus.</li>
											<li> Encourages students to be aware and knowledgeable to different problems.</li>
										</ul>
										<br>
											<h4 class="color">Solution:</h4>
										<ul>
											<li> Create a mobile application for the users to capture, compile, and send evidences about a problem that strengthens their report to the different offices that handles certain issues. </li>
											<ol>
											The application will be a platform for sending emails with pictures (optional) regarding the problem to a certain office. 
											</ol>
											<ol>
												<ol>
													Major and Minor Offenses reports are to be send to Discipline Office
													Faulty room equipment reports are to be send to Building Admin Office
													Faulty hardware or software reports are to be send to the ITRO
												</ol>
											</ol>
											<li> The application will indicate the subject of the problem to be specific in identifying the problem and compiling about that certain issue. </li>
											<li> Create a web application for the different offices to view the reports about different issues sent by different users in the school campus </li>
											<ol>The web application will be the platform of the offices on viewing the sent problems by different users. 
												The application will sort the problem base on the minor offences/issues or major offences/issues.
												The offices will reply to the sender if the report was already acknowledged or fixed.</ol>
										</ul>
										<br>
											<h4 class="color">Why do we need to solve this problem?</h4> 
										<ul>
											<li>To maintain the quality and the effectivity of the education/facilities</li> 
											<li>To reduce the problems/issues that may have a long-term effect of each individual</li> 
											<li>To make other students be aware of what is happening in the school campus.</li> 
											<li>To encourage students to help one another in reporting/solving a problem.</li> 
										</ul>
										<br>
											<h4 class="color">How did we notice this problem? </h4>
										<ul>
											<li>Some problems/issues were not aided/solved until now. </li> 
											<li>Problems/issues that seem to be low are being ignored. </li> 
											<li>No one has the strength in reporting different kinds of problem (whether it would be a major or minor offense). </li> 
										</ul>
										<br>
											<h4 class="color">What were other options you considered, and why did you choose this solution?</h4>
										<ul>
											<li>The usual option we considered was to report a problem directly to the Disciplinary Office using the Microsoft Outlook, but that can be dumped by other emails so we thought of different solutions. </li> 
											<li>We chose this solution to raise awareness inside the school campus and to give a voice to the students who sees a problem. </li> 
											<li>We think that in this solution, we can solve numerous cases/issues/problems because it is easier to send a report to the Disciplinary Office.</li> 
										</ul>

<br>
<h4 class="color"> Example 1: </h4>
Your friends keep on cheating during major exams (midterms and finals). As an honor student, they keep on asking your answers and you cannot decline them since they are your friends. You feel violated and you think it is unfair that they got the score that they didn’t deserve. You are afraid to report them to the guidance office because they will know who reported them. You don’t want them to know that you are the one who reported them but you can’t stand what they are doing. What would you do about this?
With the help of this application, you were able to report your friends without risking your identity. You logged in using your APC account. You secretly take a video on your friends while they are cheating on a quiz. You uploaded the video and sent it to the Discipline Office. Only the Discipline Office can see and view the reports that were submitted. You friends were called by the Discipline Office and sanctioned them accordingly for the major offense that they violate. They didn’t know who reported them. By reporting them to the Disicipline Office, you helped remained the integrity of the school and helped enhanced the quality of school.
<br>
<br>
<h4 class="color"> Example 2: </h4>
Before you go home from a class, you noticed that the aircon inside your classroom suddenly produced a cracking sound inside it. You don’t know where to report it, either from the guards, discipline office, building admin, or the guidance office. 
With the application, you captured a video of the aircon in which you can hear the cracking sound. You sent your report to the application. The next day you were in the different class, you didn’t know if the aircon that you report was fixed. You decided to check it if it was already fixed. Before going to the room, suddenly your phone received a notification. It was a notification from the Building Admin that your report was acknowledge and was already fixed.
